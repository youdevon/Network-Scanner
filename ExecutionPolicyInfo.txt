PowerShell Execution Policy (For Current User Only)

Recommended (safer):
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

Allow all scripts for current user (use with caution):
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Bypass

Notes:
- Applies ONLY to the current logged-in user.
- Does NOT modify system-wide or machine-level policy.
- Useful when running tools like NetScanner without admin rights.
